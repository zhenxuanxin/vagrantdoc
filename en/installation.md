# INSTALLING VAGRANT #
Install Vagrant is extremely easy. Head over to the [downloads page][downloads] and get the appropriate installer or package for your platform. Then install it using standard procedures for your operating system.

The installer will automatically add `vagrant` to your system path so that it is available in terminals. If it is not found, please try logging out and logging back in to your system (this is particularyly necessary sometimes for Windows).

If you hava an old version of Vagrant 1.0.x installed via RubyGems, please remove it prior to installing a newer v ersion of Vagrant.

> GEM INSTALL?
> Vagrant 1.0.x had the option to be installed as a [RubyGem][rubygems]. This installation method has been removed for installers and packages only.

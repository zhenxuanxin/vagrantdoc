# Usage

The Vagrant VirtualBox provider is used just like any other provider. Please read the general [basic usage][basic-usage] page for providers.

The value to use for the `--provider` flag is `virtualbox`.

The Vagrant VirtualBox provider does not support parallel execution at this time. Specifying the `--parallel` option will have no effect.

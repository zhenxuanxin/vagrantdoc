[HashiCorp][hashicorp] develops an official [VMware Fusion][fusion] and [VMware Workstation][workstation]  [provider][providers] for Vagrant. This provider allows Vagrant to power VMware based machines and take advantage of the improved stability and performance that VMware software offers.

Learn more about the VMware providers on the [VMware provider][vmware] page on the Vagrant website.

This provider is a drop-in replacement for VirtualBox, meaning that every VirtualBox feature that Vagrant supports is fully functional in VMware as well. However, there are some VMware-specific things such as box formats, configurations, etc. that are documented here.

For the most up-to-date information on compatability and supported versions of VMware Fusion and VMware Workstation, please visit the [Vagrant VMware product page][vmware]. Please note that VMware Fusion and VMware Workstation are third-party products that must be purchased and installed separately prior to using the provider.
